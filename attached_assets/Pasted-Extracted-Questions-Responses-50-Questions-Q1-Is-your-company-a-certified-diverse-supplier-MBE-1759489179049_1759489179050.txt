Q3
Please inform us how your organizations’ diversity, equity & inclusion practices will benefit CVS Health’s diversity, equity & inclusion efforts and how will you measure success.

Response:

As a certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), 100% of CVS Health's spend with Aquent is considered diverse. We are committed to fostering a workplace where diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are valued. Our DEI Council, with executive sponsors and advisors, guides our DEI goals and policies.

Our practices that can benefit CVS Health include:

Diverse Talent Sourcing: We partner with the Professional Diversity Network to ensure our job postings reach eight different diversity groups. We also launched Diversity+, a data-driven solution to help clients build a more diverse workforce by reaching underrepresented communities and reducing bias through anonymized resumes and gender-neutral job descriptions.
Internal Initiatives: We have multiple Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), including BIPOC, Latinx, LGBTQIA+, and Neurodiversity groups. We also conduct internal training on "Allyship at Work," host a "Candid Conversations" speaker series on bias and experiences, and have incorporated supporting DEI programs as a key performance objective in our review process.
Inclusive Benefits: We have expanded our healthcare services to include Enhanced Gender Affirming Coverage, increased fertility treatment coverage, and provide travel expense reimbursement for covered medical procedures not available in an employee's home state.
We measure success by auditing our recruitment lifecycle, conducting diversity audits, publishing internal demographic data, and tracking representation within our talent network, which is currently 55% female, 49% BIPOC, and 15% LGBTQ.
