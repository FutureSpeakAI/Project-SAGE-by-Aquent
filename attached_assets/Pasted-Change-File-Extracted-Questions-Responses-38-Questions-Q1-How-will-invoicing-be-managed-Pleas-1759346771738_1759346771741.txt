Q3: Provide a plan to support the Clarisonic DMI Brand Marketing team with creation of all 2020 brand initiatives including launch and seasonal assets that are primarily digital-first in nature. Need creative skills from the agency for creation of these assets but, also in creation of some smaller seasonal campaigns.

Response: The plan to support the Clarisonic DMI Brand Marketing team involves the following:

Re-branding Execution: The DMI Brand Marketing team and an outside agency are managing the re-branding strategy. The selected agency will receive all completed re-branding assets, such as the new logo, tagline, and key visuals. The agency's role will be to execute this new branding and cascade it through all future work and briefs.
Creative Briefs: All creative briefs will come from the DMI Brand Marketing Team, which is a small team, simplifying the process.
Photoshoots: For major product launches, the DMI will manage photoshoots and provide the assets. For simpler product PDP asset shoots, the agency will be responsible for managing and supplying the photographer and a stylist if needed. These shoots will not require models or makeup artists.
Video Creative: The agency's scope for video will primarily consist of editing shorter cuts from existing videos that will be provided.
Staffing: The proposed team includes roles such as a Creative Account Manager, Designers, a Copywriter, and a Video Editor to provide the necessary creative skills.

Streamlined Communication: Creative briefs will originate from the small DMI Brand Marketing Team, which is expected to be less complicated than working with a larger team.
On-site Presence: For key meetings like creative brief reviews or kickoffs, an agency representative would ideally be present on-site, but the team would not be permanently co-located.
Simplified Creative Structure: The internal creative studio at Clarisonic was eliminated, meaning the agency will not need to coordinate with an internal creative team after the transition period ending on 3/15.
