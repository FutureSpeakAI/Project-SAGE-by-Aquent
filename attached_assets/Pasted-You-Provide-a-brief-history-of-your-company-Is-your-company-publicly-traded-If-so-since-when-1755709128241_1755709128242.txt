We have been in business for over 30 years and are a premier provider of digital, marketing, and creative service solutions worldwide²'³'⁴. Aquent Studios is the digital agency and managed services division of our parent company, Aquent LLC¹'⁵. We are a certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) with a Corporate Plus Designation⁶'⁷.

Our headquarters is located at 501 Boylston St., Third Floor, Boston, MA 02116⁸. While we previously maintained 36 offices in 7 countries, we are now a remote-first workforce, which allows us to hire the best and most diverse talent globally⁹.

Publicly Traded Status Aquent is not a publicly traded company¹⁰. We are a private, closely-held company, and our owner has mandated that we do not share detailed financial information with outside parties¹¹'¹²'¹³.

Alliances and Partnerships Aquent maintains several strategic alliances to enhance our service delivery. These partnerships primarily benefit our clients by providing access to specialized expertise and technology platforms.

Amazon Web Services (AWS): Aquent has a longstanding relationship with Amazon, serving as a trusted partner for over eight years¹⁴. In 2023, AWS selected Aquent as a Preferred Agency Partner, highlighting our impactful engagements with teams in Customer Experience, Web, and Partner Marketing¹⁵. This deep expertise in Amazon's internal processes benefits clients leveraging AWS infrastructure¹⁶.
Professional Diversity Network: We partner with the Professional Diversity Network to ensure our job postings reach their eight different diversity groups¹⁷. This alliance enhances our ability to build a diverse workforce for our clients and supports their diversity and inclusion goals¹⁸.
Technology Platform Expertise: Through partnerships with specialized agencies, we have developed deep technical knowledge of key platforms. For example, our work with Aisle Rocket Studio (ARS) has made them proficient with the Adobe Website Platform, combining technical development knowledge with a deep understanding of our clients' products¹⁹.
The provided documentation focuses on the benefits these alliances provide, such as enhanced technical capability and access to diverse talent pools. There is no information in our records detailing how these alliances might limit a client's options. [General business practice - not from internal sources]
