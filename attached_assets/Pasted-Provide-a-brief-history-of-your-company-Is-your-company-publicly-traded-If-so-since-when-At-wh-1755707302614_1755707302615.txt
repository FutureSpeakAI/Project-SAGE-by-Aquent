Alliances with Hardware, Software, or Service Providers
Aquent does not rely on third-party alliances for the scope of its work. However, it has developed proprietary tools and platforms, such as RoboHead, a project management solution tailored to internal agency environments. This tool enhances collaboration and efficiency across time zones, which can be a significant benefit for clients. Additionally, Aquent has invested in technology like Aquent Gymnasium, an online learning platform that helps creative professionals enhance their skills[2].

These proprietary tools and internal capabilities ensure that Aquent can deliver services without being limited by external dependencies, providing clients with flexibility and scalability. The absence of reliance on third-party alliances minimizes potential limitations on client options^[1].
