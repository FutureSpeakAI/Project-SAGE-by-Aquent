Please analyze the existing RFP/RFI engine components in this codebase and ensure they work correctly end-to-end. Based on the chat history, the system is "production-ready" but hasn't been tested yet.

Your tasks:

Component Analysis: Examine these key files:

server/rfp-processor.ts - Main processing logic
client/src/components/RFP/RFPResponseTab.tsx - Dedicated UI
client/src/components/FreePrompt/FreePromptTab.tsx - Integrated RFP widget
server/routes.ts - API endpoints (/api/rfp/process, /api/rfp/generate-docx, /api/rfp/generate-pdf)
test-rfp-system.js - Test suite
Test Execution: Run the existing test suite:

node test-rfp-system.js
Analyze any failures and document what's working vs. broken.

End-to-End Validation: Test the complete workflow:

Upload PDF/DOCX/TXT files through the UI
Question extraction from documents
AI response generation using Pinecone + Gemini
DOCX and PDF export functionality
Error handling and user feedback
Integration Testing: Verify:

Pinecone knowledge base integration for responses
File format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
Document generation (both DOCX and PDF)
UI responsiveness and progress indicators
Error states and user messaging
Fix Issues: Address any problems found:

File upload/processing errors
Question extraction accuracy
AI response quality and formatting
Export document generation
UI/UX issues or broken functionality
Performance Testing: Ensure:

Large document handling (up to 20MB)
Multiple question processing efficiency
Reasonable response times
Proper timeout handling
Expected Deliverables:

Status report of current functionality
List of bugs/issues found and fixed
Verification that all three main features work:
Document upload and question extraction
AI-powered response generation
Professional document export (DOCX/PDF)
Confirmation that both UI interfaces (dedicated tab + integrated widget) function properly
Testing Data: Use the existing test-rfp.txt file or create realistic RFP scenarios to validate the system thoroughly.

Focus on making this a working, production-ready feature that users can rely on for actual RFP/RFI response generation.
