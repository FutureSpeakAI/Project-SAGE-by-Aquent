Short answer: your extractor pulled the right set of prompts, but the responses miss a lot of specifics—and a few answers contradict the RFP. Here’s the tight audit.

What’s missing or incorrect

Q1 — “All questions… submitted to the L’Oréal Point of Contact by the due date…”
Your answer says the due date and POC aren’t provided. They are—names, emails, and the full schedule are in the RFP (incl. Questions due 12/26/2019 and RFP due 1/9/2020 3:00 PM ET)

Clarisonic DMI Agency 2020 RFP

. So this response is incorrect

.

Q2 — “RFP response must be submitted electronically… by the due date and time…”
You say “submit electronically” (fine), but you don’t restate the exact deadline and recipients. The RFP gives both and expects precision; include the timestamp and the listed Points of Contact

Clarisonic DMI Agency 2020 RFP

. As-is, this is too vague

RFP_Response_1759332724491

.

Q3 / Q20 — Required documents
Q3 lists the Excel response form, Ethical Commitment Letter, etc.; Q20 explicitly adds ASGS and the 3rd-Party Security & Data Assessment Form with electronic submission before the deadline. Your Q3 mentions ASGS but doesn’t bring in the security assessment; Q20 does. Net: covered but fragmented. I’d consolidate so the first “docs” answer is exhaustive

Q4 — “Be ready to present in person at Hudson Yards (NYC) or as specified”
Your answer says there’s no info about an in-person presentation. The RFP explicitly requires it (and notes details shared by Dec 30)

. Incorrect

Q5 — “Be ready to receive Clarisonic for a site visit”
Your answer says there’s no such requirement; the RFP says there is

. Incorrect

Q6–Q8, Q10–Q19 — The substantive proposal content
These are the meat: company philosophy, experience (with client references), solution plan, techniques/process, transition timeline, comms/reporting model, staffing plan + org chart, sample profiles, invoicing approach (incl. frequency and itemized lines), company info for the in-person deck, proposed fee (FTE tables + cost breakdown), and references.
Your doc mostly replies with “not in the provided context” or “See response to Q1.” That’s a placeholder, not an answer. These sections require your actual content (Aquent’s story, approach, org chart, rate model, deliverable pricing tables, etc.). As-is, they are not answered

.
Specific call-outs:

Q15 invoicing: you cite L’Oréal’s generic AP rules, but the RFP asks for your invoicing plan (frequency of cost breakdowns + itemization). Provide cadence (e.g., monthly), example invoice structure, and how you map line-items to deliverables/SOW milestones

.

Q18 fee model: you include neither the FTE resource table nor the “Breakdown of Costs by Category/Deliverable”—both are explicitly requested

Not extracted as a question, but important to address in your proposal text
The RFP’s evaluation criteria include SBWA & Solidarity Sourcing and Economic Dependence (<30% of your total revenue). Even if not a numbered prompt, it’s wise to include a short statement and examples to score those criteria

What to fix (in order of pain relief)

Replace the incorrect administrative answers with specifics from the RFP.
Include the schedule dates and the Points of Contact exactly as listed; name the submission emails and the Jan 9, 2020 3:00 PM ET deadline in the body of your response

Write the substantive sections (Q6–Q14, Q16–Q19).
Don’t say “not in context.” These are prompts for your content. Add:

Aquent’s philosophy, values, and creative ops approach.

3–5 relevant case briefs with client contacts (per RFP).

Your Clarisonic-specific plan: asset workflows, review rounds, model rights handling, file-naming & server upload process, and how you’ll integrate with DMI timelines.

Transition plan and timeline (what happens weeks 0–12); roles + org chart; on-/off-site mix; named sample profiles.

Comms/reporting model: cadences, tooling, who attends, what artifacts (status, RAID log, dashboards).

Invoicing plan: frequency (e.g., monthly, net terms noted), itemization schema (by deliverable, phase, and OOP like proofs/retouching).

Fee model: FTE tables by role + rate and breakdown by category/deliverable that maps to the 2020 calendar in the scope

Add the evaluation niceties.
Short paragraphs on SBWA/Solidarity Sourcing initiatives and a one-liner confirming L’Oréal’s <30% revenue dependency threshold help downstream scoring
