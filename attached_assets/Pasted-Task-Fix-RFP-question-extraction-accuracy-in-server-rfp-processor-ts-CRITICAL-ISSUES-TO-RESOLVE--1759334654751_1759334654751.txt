Task: Fix RFP question extraction accuracy in server/rfp-processor.ts
CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE:
1. extractQuestionsWithAI() is extracting imperative instructions as questions
2. Table data (contacts, schedules, deadlines) is being lost during DOCX parsing
3. System may be influenced by response document formatting instead of pure RFP content
FILES TO MODIFY:
1. server/rfp-processor.ts - extractQuestionsWithAI() function:
   - Update Gemini prompt to explicitly exclude imperative instructions ("Submit by...", "Provide documentation...")
   - Add instruction to preserve table data as structured text
   - Filter out Q&A scaffolding patterns (Q1:, Q2:, etc.)
   - Focus only on actual questions requiring vendor responses
2. server/brief-processing.ts - extractTextFromFile() function:
   - Enhance DOCX table parsing to preserve structure
   - Mark table boundaries and column headers
   - Maintain contact information and schedule formatting
3. Create test-rfp-extraction-accuracy.js:
   - Test with attached_assets/Clarisonic DMI Agency 2020 RFP_1759334466109.docx
   - Verify no fabricated Q&A patterns
   - Confirm table data preservation
   - Ensure imperatives aren't treated as questions
KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract ONLY genuine vendor questions from the RFP document
- Preserve contact tables, schedules, and deadline information
- Exclude submission instructions and administrative directives
- Maintain original question formatting and context
VALIDATION: Test extraction should find actual RFP questions while preserving all structured data (contacts, deadlines, evaluation criteria tables).
Test Plan
File: test-rfp-extraction-accuracy.js

Assertions:

No fabricated Q&A: Extracted questions must not contain "Q1:", "Q2:" patterns from response scaffolding
Imperative exclusion: Instructions like "Submit documentation by..." should not appear in extracted questions
Table preservation: Contact information, deadlines, and structured data must be retained in extracted text
Question authenticity: All extracted items must be genuine questions requiring vendor responses, not administrative instructions
Test data: Use attached_assets/Clarisonic DMI Agency 2020 RFP_1759334466109.docx as source truth, ignore the response PDF completely.
