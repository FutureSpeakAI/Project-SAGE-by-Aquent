To manage this service holistically, we'll deploy a hybrid model combining onsite and virtual resources, supported by centralized services. The Core Team will include roles such as Project Manager, Marketing Strategist, and Data Analyst, stationed at key Coca-Cola locations for seamless integration, while Flex resources like Creative Designers and Copywriters will operate virtually for agility.

(a) Scaling the Core Team: We'll use a phased onboarding process, initially deploying essential personnel to establish foundational operations. As workload increases, we’ll scale up by tapping into a pre-vetted pool of Flex resources, ensuring rapid response without compromising quality.

(b) Adjusting Resources: Within the first six months, we’ll conduct regular workload assessments to align resource allocation. Using a dynamic resource management system, we’ll adjust team composition in real-time based on project demands and Coca-Cola’s strategic priorities.

(c) Cost Management: Resource balancing costs will be transparent, with a structured pricing model. It includes fixed costs for Core Team members and variable costs for Flex resources, ensuring flexibility while controlling expenses. Regular financial reviews will optimize resource allocation and manage budget effectively.
