Company Overview and History
Brief History of the Company
Aquent was founded in 1986 as a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) in Massachusetts. Over the past 30+ years, Aquent has established itself as a global leader in marketing and creative staffing, as well as a premier provider of digital, marketing, and creative service solutions worldwide. Aquent Studios, the agency division of Aquent, specializes in implementing and managing customized, outsourced creative services solutions for clients across industries[2].

Publicly Traded Status
Aquent is a privately held company and is not publicly traded. As a closely-held private company, Aquent does not share detailed financial information externally or internally[2].

Years in Business
Aquent has been in business for over 37 years, having been founded in 1986. Aquent Studios, its agency division, has been providing creative services for more than 20 years[2].

Alliances with Hardware, Software, or Service Providers
Aquent does not currently leverage alliances with third-party hardware, software, or service providers for the scope of its work. However, the company has invested in proprietary tools such as RoboHead, a project management solution tailored to internal agency environments, and Aquent Gymnasium, an online learning platform for upskilling creative professionals. These tools enhance operational efficiency and ensure high-quality service delivery. Aquent’s independence from third-party alliances ensures flexibility and avoids limitations on client options[1].
