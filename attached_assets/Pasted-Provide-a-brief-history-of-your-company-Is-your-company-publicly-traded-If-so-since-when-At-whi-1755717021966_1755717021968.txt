Company History and Structure
Aquent was founded on May 22, 1986, in Massachusetts and is structured as a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)¹'7. The parent company of Aquent LLC is Triventures, which owns 99.8% of the company7. For over 30 years, Aquent has established itself as the global leader in marketing and creative staffing¹'4'5'6.

Our company is composed of two primary service divisions:

Aquent: The recruiting and staffing services arm, with 34 years of experience, accounts for approximately 75% of total firm revenue¹.
Aquent Studios: The digital agency division, with 22 years of experience, is expert at implementing and managing customized, outsourced creative services solutions and accounts for 25% of firm revenue¹. Aquent Studios provides a broad spectrum of creative development, including visual design, digital, content, video, and web development, for leading global brands4'5'6.
We have a significant global presence, with operations in the US, Canada, France, UK, Netherlands, Australia, and Japan¹. We are currently moving to a remote-first workforce to hire the best and most diverse talent globally¹.

Public Trading Status
Aquent is a closely-held private company and is not publicly traded¹'7. In response to direct questions about stock exchange and ticker symbols, our answer is "N/A"¹. Our owner has mandated that we do not share detailed financial information with outside parties¹'¹°'¹³'¹4.

However, to assure clients of our financial stability, we can share the following:

Our annual revenue from continuing operations is in excess of $400M¹.
Our financial statements have always been audited by an independent CPA firm and have received clean opinions¹'¹°'¹³'¹4.
We have a strong balance sheet, are well-capitalized, and secured a $55 million line of credit with a large US national bank¹°'¹³'¹4.
Our DUNS number is 15-727-1578¹'¹°'¹³'¹4.
Should further financial assurance be required, our Controller is available to address specific concerns directly¹'¹°'¹³'¹4.

Years in Business
Aquent was founded in 19867. We have been in business for over three decades, with various documents citing "over 30 years"¹, "32 years"¹°'¹³'¹4, and "34 years"¹ for our staffing services division, all confirming our long and stable history.

Alliances and Partnerships
Aquent’s model is built on self-sufficiency and direct service delivery. In a past response for a scope of work similar to this, we stated that Aquent does not intend on leveraging any 3rd parties7.

This approach provides significant benefits to our clients:

Quality Control: By not relying on external partners, we maintain direct control over the quality and performance of our employees and deliverables7.
Accountability: A single point of contact and a unified team ensure clear accountability and streamlined communication. [General business practice - not from internal sources]
Efficiency: Our integrated model, combining staffing expertise with studio services, allows us to build dedicated teams and leverage a core-flex model to manage fluctuating workloads effectively7.
This self-contained model is a key differentiator, ensuring that the team supporting your business is composed of dedicated Aquent professionals managed under our proven processes.

4. Competitive Positioning and Differentiators
Unmatched Experience: With a history dating back to 1986, we have unparalleled experience in the creative and marketing services industry¹'7.
Integrated Service Model: The combination of Aquent's global leadership in talent and Aquent Studios' expertise in outsourced creative solutions provides a unique, holistic solution that other firms cannot match¹'4'5'6.
Proven Financial Stability: As a large, private, and profitable company, we offer the stability of a major corporation without the quarterly pressures of a publicly-traded firm¹'¹°'¹³'¹4.
Direct Delivery and Accountability: Our strategic decision to self-perform work rather than relying on third-party alliances ensures higher quality, consistency, and direct accountability to our clients7.
5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
Risk: The client may perceive our status as a private company that does not release detailed financial statements as a potential risk¹'¹°'¹³'¹4.
Mitigation: We proactively address this by providing key indicators of financial health (e.g., annual revenue over $400M, clean audits, significant line of credit) and offering a direct conversation with our Controller to address any concerns¹'¹°'¹³'¹4. This demonstrates transparency and confidence in our financial position.
Risk: The client may have a preference or requirement for solutions that involve multiple third-party partners.
Mitigation: We must clearly articulate the benefits of our self-delivery model, focusing on the advantages of quality control, streamlined project management, and singular accountability7. We can position this as a strategic strength that reduces complexity and risk for the client.
