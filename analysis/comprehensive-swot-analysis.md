  userConsent: ConsentLevel;
  dataRetention: RetentionPolicy;
  rightToErasure: ErasureHandler;
  dataPortability: ExportHandler;
  anonymization: AnonymizationEngine;
}
```

#### 2. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
**Gap**: No enterprise-grade data segregation for multiple organizations
**Impact**: Data leakage between clients, enterprise sales blocker
**Evidence**: Current SessionContext doesn't include tenant/organization boundaries

```typescript
// Missing: Tenant isolation
interface TenantContext {
  organizationId: string;
  userRole: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'viewer';
  dataIsolationLevel: 'strict' | 'shared' | 'federated';
  crossTenantLearning: boolean;
}
```
